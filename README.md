# IUTPC Rating System
This project was developed for the Software Engineering and Object Oriented Design Project and Relational Database Management System project of our junior year. 
In IUT, there is a programming community. This community creates and moderates team for different IUPCs held in Bangladesh. But during the team formation it faces great problem because there is no generalised rating system in IUT. 

This project is a web scraper project. IUTPC has decided to organise weekly contest on vjudge and also use some of the Codeforces official round as their official contest. The ranklist of these official contest is fetched and the processed and this program generate a generalised rating for each of the participant. 

Currently, the whole program is developed in python. We used libraries like:
Requests, 
BeautifulSoup, 
Pandas,
Cx_Oracle,
and for UI we used TKinter library of python. 

Some of the core features are:
----------------------------------------------------
Option for mandatory contest,
Division System (which is automatically trigerred),
Automatic Rating calculation, id verification by codeforces etc.
